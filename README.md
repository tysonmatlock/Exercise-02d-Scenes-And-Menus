In addition to the satisfactory requirements of this project, I incorporated the following:
- Used different assets for the sprites.
- Gave the game a background image that I created myself.
- Used a unique font across the game.
- Added an explosion after the destruction of objects from a sprite sheet.
- Added music across the game.
- Added a sound effect when the "Start" or "Restart" button is pressed.
- Fine-tuned the speed of both the bullets and the ship to promote a more organic feel of the overall game.
